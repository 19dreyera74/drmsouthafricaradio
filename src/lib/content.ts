  intro:
    "The Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) broadcasting system has been designed by broadcasters, for broadcasters, with the active assistance and participation of both transmitter and receiver manufacturers and other interested parties, such as regulatory bodies.",
  openStandard:
    "DRM is an open standard — its system description is openly published, giving all manufacturers and interested parties free access to the complete technical specifications. They can design and manufacture equipment on an equitable basis without paying a licence fee to the DRM Consortium. This has proved an important mechanism for the timely introduction of new systems to market, and for accelerating the rate at which equipment prices fall.",
  noFees:
    "There is no per-use fee, annual payment, or similar cost for DRM technology — not for broadcasters or network operators, nor for broadcast or receiver equipment manufacturers. The DRM Consortium is not involved in managing or receiving any IPR royalty for DRM products; royalties are paid directly to the individual IPR holders, unless already resolved by a component supplier (e.g. for a DRM receiver module).",
  bands:
    "DRM is the only global digital radio standard that embraces all the currently used radio frequency bands. It was designed specifically as a high-quality digital replacement for former analogue radio broadcasting in the AM and FM/VHF bands, and can be operated with the same channelling and spectrum allocations already employed.",
  modes: [
    {
      name: "Below 30 MHz",
      detail:
        "Four different robustness modes tailor the DRM signal for AM broadcast bands and their diverse propagation characteristics — enabling regional up to international service coverage.",
    },
    {
      name: "Above 30 MHz",
      detail:
        "A dedicated robustness mode, centred on the FM broadcast band and optimised for VHF transmissions, is used for local to regional service coverage.",
    },
  ],
  regulatory:
    "DRM has received the necessary recommendations from the ITU, providing international regulatory support for transmissions. The main DRM standard is published by ETSI, which also publishes and holds the repository of the entire range of current DRM technical standards.",
  benefits:
    "DRM allows a broadcaster to provide listeners with significant improvements in service reliability, audio quality and, most importantly, usability — with features and facilities impossible to replicate in analogue broadcasting. It is essential that prospective broadcasters understand the potential and flexibility of the system to optimise and configure their DRM networks for their own market conditions.",
};

export const about = {
  lead: "The DRM SA GROUP is the revitalised voice of digital radio in South Africa — a bold new chapter born from the re-launch of what was formerly known as the DRM SA PLATFORM, now under the banner of the DRM Consortium.",
  mission:
    "Following the South African government's July 2020 policy directive on introducing Digital Sound Broadcasting, the timing was perfect to re-ignite efforts to drive awareness, engagement and adoption of the Digital Radio Mondiale (DRM) standard in the region. Our mission: to prepare Southern Africa's radio landscape for its digital evolution.",
  legacy:
    "The journey toward digital radio began over two decades ago in South Africa. In 2014, the DRM Consortium launched the Southern Africa Platform, spearheaded by the Managing Director of Radio Pulpit — leading to South Africa's first successful DRM trial on AM (mediumwave). Soon after, Kofifi FM 97.2, a community station in Johannesburg, achieved a successful DRM trial on FM, supported by Wecodec and local partners — findings that have been recognised as an official ITU document, ready for global publication.",
  objectives: [
    "Promote DRM as the digital broadcasting standard of choice for South Africa and beyond",
    "Build widespread awareness among broadcasters, government, manufacturers, suppliers, retailers and the public",
    "Champion adoption and influence key stakeholders across the radio ecosystem",
    "Serve as South Africa's trusted DRM authority, offering credible, up-to-date information and guidance on all things DRM",
  ],
  whyNow:
    "DRM is a global digital radio standard that works across all frequency bands — AM, FM, SW and VHF. It's tailor-made for countries with large, diverse geographies like those in Southern Africa. Whether a national broadcaster, regional station or grassroots community radio operator, DRM delivers crystal-clear audio, interactive content and enhanced services to more people than ever before. It's cost-effective, spectrum-efficient, energy-saving, and ready for Africa.",
  global:
    "DRM SA is proud to stand alongside national DRM platforms from countries like India, Germany, Brazil, Russia and the USA, all working toward a shared global vision: the digital transformation of radio. We are a non-profit group committed to supporting broadcasters, communities and governments in making this digital leap together.",
  closing: "Let's broadcast the future — together.",

Alongside the technical demonstrations, the project will assess digital-era business processes for broadcasters, explore new revenue opportunities, and stimulate local receiver manufacturing across portable, in-car, and mobile platforms. Key stakeholders—including broadcasters, signal distributors, the automotive industry, government entities, and receiver manufacturers—will be actively involved throughout the 8-month demonstration period.",

The event brought together broadcasters, industry experts, and technology partners to explore the progress and potential of DRM in the region. Presentations made by South African experts and colleagues in the umbrella DRM Consortium highlighted DRM’s efficiency in energy and spectrum use, its ability to broadcast multiple channels on a single frequency, and its applications in education and emergency communication.",
      "To increase audience engagement, attendees participated in live Slido polls, a way to provide live feedback and share their own perspectives. These showed that over half of the participants were already familiar with DRM, while another 25% were somewhat familiar. Interestingly, 43% identified commercial radio and advertising as the sector most likely to benefit from DRM, followed by community radio (29%). A big vote of confidence and interest were shown for the potential of DRM in education/distance learning (29%).",
      "As to the challenges and barriers to implementation, costs and limited awareness were cited as the most important, though 56% rated DRM’s energy and spectrum efficiency as “very valuable” to broadcasters. The webinar concluded with a strong call for on-air demonstrations, business plan development, and broader public education as those involved in the event reaffirmed collective commitment to advancing digital radio adoption across Southern Africa.",
